    <h2>Son Goku History</h2>
    <p>Born under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, 
        he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza.
        Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the
        adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku.
        The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, 
        until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. 
        Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further influence Goku, 
        who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.</p>
